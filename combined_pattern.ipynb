      "- Purpose: Introduce a language (e.g., Python) to beginners, focusing on beginner-friendly benefits.\n",
      "- Key benefits to highlight:\n",
      "  - Readability: clean, straightforward syntax that makes code easy to understand.\n",
      "  - Versatility: applicable to many domains (web, data, automation, scripting, small apps).\n",
      "  - Libraries: extensive, well-maintained packages available via a central repository.\n",
      "  - Community: large, welcoming communities with abundant learning resources and support.\n",
      "  - Job demand: solid demand for entry-level skills and clear career pathways.\n",
      "  - Rapid development: quick feedback loop, fast prototyping and testing.\n",
      "- Tone: simple, plain language; concise explanations; minimal jargon; concrete examples.\n",
      "- Depth: enough to inform a beginner about why the language is approachable and worth learning, without diving into advanced topics.\n",
      "- Deliverables: an introductory overview or module outline, with example code snippets and pointers to beginner resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Audience (who this is for)\n",
      "- Primary audience:\n",
      "  - People new to programming (students, career changers, hobbyists) seeking an approachable entry point.\n",
      "  - Non-technical professionals exploring coding as a tool for automate tasks or data work.\n",
      "- Secondary audience:\n",
      "  - Educators and mentors helping beginners get started.\n",
      "  - HR or hiring managers evaluating beginner-friendly languages for onboarding new engineers.\n",
      "- Needs and goals of the audience:\n",
      "  - Understand why the language is approachable.\n",
      "  - See concrete benefits that matter to newcomers (readable syntax, quick wins, supportive community).\n",
      "  - Feel confident about taking the first steps (hello world, simple scripts, small projects).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tone and language guidelines\n",
      "- Use short sentences and plain terms.\n",
      "- Define any essential terms before using them.\n",
      "- Include concrete, beginner-friendly examples.\n",
      "- Avoid jargon or explain it when used.\n",
      "- Maintain an encouraging, approachable voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boundaries\n",
      "- Do not cover advanced topics (performance tuning, concurrency, low-level internals).\n",
      "- Do not compare in-depth with many other languages; keep focus on beginner benefits.\n",
      "- Do not assume prior programming experience beyond basic computer use.\n",

      "- A clear scope and audience statement is produced.\n",
      "- The piece communicates the six beginner-friendly benefits and why they matter.\n",
